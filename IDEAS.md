# PlayTest Notes:

### Bauble Tag Stuff

- add remaining players in the sidebar for bauble tag.

Extra considerations:

- streamline cameraslide
- also rework avalanche roof designs/ideas.
- work out scoring ratio (games like paint wars cant add 4000+ points)

### Bugs which I don't want to spam on the discord
- Terminating a game in its camera phase
